# Region Filter

Region Filter is a lightweight WoW addon for tagging the region and data centre location for groups in group finder. As an ex-OCE player, this was always frustrating because grouping with US servers meant 360ms or more.

The addon is very simple and has no configuration. The only thing you can toggle is whether or not groups from outside of your region are removed from the group finder. This can be toggled with the command:

`/rfilter`

If you are using the wonderful [CurseBreaker](https://github.com/AcidWeb/CurseBreaker) please add this addon as a GitHub source and avoid giving CurseForge (soon/now Overwolf) the traffic.

You can do this by calling:

`install gh:jamesb93/RegionFilter`

Any bugs, please make a report here and if you have suggestions or PR's I'm happy to review them when I have the time.
